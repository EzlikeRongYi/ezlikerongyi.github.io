									<h3>How I Got Here.</h3>
									<p>I must admit that I was one of those individuals that spent years feeling <i>unsure</i> about their career path.
										I spent 10 years to figure out that Data Science was my calling, it wasn't an easy journey <i>(probably more downs than ups)</i> but I'm thankful to be where I am today.
										I started my career as a hotelier in 2017 after graduating with a bachelor's in Tourism, Events Management & Hospitality. After 2.5 years in the frontline, I decided to try for a change and joined a travel agency as sales in 2019.
									</p>									
									<p><b>Then the pandemic struck.</b></p>
									<p>
										I made a move to NTUC as a temp admin, supporting the team in administrative duties and mostly Excel based work. As the situation worsened,
										I was recommended to move to e2i, where I supported the disbursement of training allowance (NTUC Training Fund) for Self-Employed Persons (SEPs). Once my contracted ended in Jul 2021, I was offered a full-time position as a Career Centre Specialist, where I honed my Excel, communication and analytical skills.
									</p>									
									<p>								 										
										I have gain a wealth of knowledge in communications and time management over the years, and I continued to learn by taking Data Analytics courses from Coursera, NTUC LearningHub, ICDL and Codecademy.
										Fast forward till today, I am now a Data Analyst at DBS Bank (Consumer Banking Group) while pursuing my 2nd bachelor's degree in Data Science & Analytics.
									</p>
									<p>
										Hello, this is me and welcome to my portfolio!

									<h2>Things I Do Out-of-Work</h2>
									<p><span class="image right"><img src="images/collage.jpg" alt="" id="collage-img"/></span>
										Of course there's more to life than just work; having some downtime also helps me to refocus and refresh my mind. While I'm not at work, my hobbies include video gaming for my mind, where my genre of choice will be single-players.
										Some of my favourite games include The Last Of Us, The Witcher 3, Horizon Zero Dawn & Forbidden West, God of War (from 2005 onwards), Red Dead Redemption 2, Bioshock, and many more. I also enjoy watching videos explaining the mysteries of the universe, latest & greatest in computer science,
										PC hardware reviews, and the latest tech news.
									</p>
									<p>As for the body, I will go out for runs, gym or shoot some hoops 2-3x a week. My usual routine will be a 4km run followed by 3 sets of static exercises. </p>
									<p>If I'm not doing either of those, then most likely you'll find me in the kitchen, learning to whip up something. My self-proclaimed signature cuisine would be Korean, such as Tteokguk, Dak-Galbi & Kimchi Fried Rice.</p>
